# Getting started (Run the application)
This assignment is getting driven by unit-tests, or you can also go to GroceryApplication.java and run the main method

# Things I tried to follow :
1. I have created all domain models/enums 

2. I used lombok for getter,setters, constructors

3. I tried to create  methods & variables names 

4. I Tried to avoid code duplication by refactoring/reusing duplicate code

5. I have chosen Nashorn Script Engine to define offers, since we can define and change easily

6. I used java 1.8

7. There is no warning in the code now. I have checked project using Intellij Idea code cleanup. 
I would be able to use SonarQube if there was a ready one

# Things I could have done/improved if given more time :
1. More comments in the code
